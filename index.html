            <p class="description">
                With over 1.3 years of experience in software testing, I am a softwarw QA Analyst at Aperto Global,
                a leading provider of web and mobile solutions. I manage agile teams of up to 25 members on a wide range
                of projects, from planning and estimation to execution and delivery. I also spearhead agile ceremonies,
                participate in governance meetings, and work with the product owner on product backlog refinement.

                I have a strong background in both automation and manual testing, and I have designed and implemented
                Selenium WebDriver automation frameworks for smoke and regression test suites using TestNG and Maven. I
                have successfully delivered cost-effective and quality-focused solutions for clients such as UBS, and I
                have received multiple awards for creating value-added tools and best practices. I am highly organized
                and self-motivated, have excellent communication skills, and thrive in high-pressure environments. My
                goal is to leverage my technical expertise, business acumen, and agile leadership skills to deliver
                outstanding results for Aperto Global and its clients.
